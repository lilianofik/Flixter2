### Notes
The main challenges I experienced are the same challenges I experienced from the beginning of this course. I need time to settle and understand the interface of Android Studio so I can do better work.

## Open-source libraries used
- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/codepath/CPAsyncHttpClient) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - Image loading and caching library for Android

The Part 1:

### User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:
#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [ ] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
- [ ] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [ ] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [ ] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

## Notes

I was very confused doing this exercise but it just encouraged me to want to learn more so I can get more accustomed to the interface and the novelty of the app.
